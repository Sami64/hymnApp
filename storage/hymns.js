				"Jesus! The name that charms our fears,\nThat bids our sorrows cease,\n'Tis music in the sinner's ears,\n'Tis life, and health, and peace.",
				"He speaks, and, listening to His voice,\nNew life the dead receive,\nThe mournful, broken hearts rejoice,\nThe humble poor believe",
				"He breaks the power of cancelled sin,\nHe sets the prisoner free;\nHis blood can make the foulest clean,\nHis blood availed for me.",
				"See all your sins on Jesus laid;\nThe lamb of God was slain,\nHis soul was once an offering made\nFor every soul of man",
